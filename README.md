This site showcases OOP and software design/principle. The objective is to be an easy to digest resource for intermediate to advance topics in software development.

This site is a reflection of my own personal studies in OOP. The goal is not to be a replacement for documentation, but rather provide a more approachable alternative. In every case, I would suggest looking into the documentation of the programming language of your choice for more indepth explanation for various topics.
