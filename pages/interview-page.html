      <h2 class="sub-heading">Actual Interview Questions</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        The following are Interview questions I received from a company in June
        whose tech stack included C#/.NET/SQL Server.<br />
        "On a scale 1 to 5, how confident are you in C#?"<br />
        1. What does the static keyword mean? <br />2. What is the difference
        between an abstract and an interface? <br />3. What is the Linq
        framework in C#? <br />4. What is the Entity framework in .NET?<br />
        5. What does the IDisposable interface do?<br />
        6. What does SOLID state for in OOP?<br />7. Can you explain INNER JOINS
        vs OUTER JOINS?<br />
        8. What is meant by readonly?<br />
        9. What is a value reference?<br />
        <br />

        These questions were simple knowledge checks pertaining to C# and OOP
        design principles. Coming from a Java background, I was not familiar
        with Linq and Entity frameworks which hurt my chances at this interview.
        It was actually this interview that inspired the creation of this site!
        I wanted there to exist a site that showed how approach the job hunt
        puzzle in an approachable way.

      <h2 class="sub-heading">First Interview Info</h2>
      <a id="firstInterview"></a>
      <p class="post-text">
        There are numberous things you can be asked in a developer interview. It
        is important to evaluate not only whether you know the answer to these
        questions, but also how articulate you are when you answer them.

        <br /><br />Keep the interviewer in mind when you are answering. This
        allows you to gage what the interviewer is hoping to ascertain by asking
        the questions. Usually during the techinal interview, the first few
        questions are simple knowledge checks. Things such as: "what is an
        array", "what is unit testing", "what is a JOIN in SQL", are all surface
        level questions if you have any experience with software questions.

        <br /><br />Other interviews are code reviews, meaning writing out code
        to solve a problem. The point of these reviews are not actually to see
        if you can solve the problem, even though that would be bonus, it is an
        opportunity for the interviewer to see how you problem solve.

        <br /><br />If you don't communicate and magically come up with the
        answer, it tells the interviewer next to nothing. Explaining how you
        came to solution or how you would research the code to solve it provides
        much information.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Studying for the Interview</h2>
      <a id="studyInterview"></a>
      <p class="post-text">
        The final thing to touch on is studying for the interview. You should
        know what market the business is in and who their potential clients are.
        Both of which can be found out on their website, usually in an About Us
        section.
        <br /><br />
        As for the techinal interview, your primary study should be based on the
        list of job requirements/ skills that were on the application. There may
        technologies listed there that you are not familiar with. Research those
        so you are at least on speaking terms to what the technology does and
        how it benefits that teams' tech stack. Your more indepth study/review
        should be on technologies that are relevant day to day if you land the
        job there.

        <br /><br />No one has the infinite time to study the 20+ techs that are
        listed in every job application. These job applications are usually
        written by hiring departments and/or senior staff who may not know the
        priority of the technologies listed. This means it is in your best
        interest to figure out what they are looking for.

        <br />
        <br />The application may say front-end developer, but if the
        application states the applicant must have working knowledge of
        microservices and MongoDB then it is really a full-stack position. The
        company are likely building web applications that require back-end
        support so reviewing SQL and databases may give you an edge. Even if you
        are wrong this assumption, you can ask the interviewer about their
        current project and tech stack. This is a great opportunity to show your
        interest in the company and willingness to do research.
