      <h2 class="sub-heading">SOLID Design</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        In order to make flexible, scalable, and efficient code, it is
        recommended to follow the SOLID design principles. SOLID is an acronym
        for 5 principles: Single Responsibility, Open Closed, Liskow
        Subsitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Single Responsiblity Principle</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Single Responsiblity Principle states that a class should only have one
        responsibility. This does not mean it should only have one method,
        rather, it's focus should be singular. For example, the Math class only
        contains math functions and not string manipulation.
      </p>

      <h2 class="sub-heading">Open Closed Principle</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Open Closed Principle states that a class should be open for
        implemenation but closed for manipulation. A class should be accessible
        as needed, however, it should not be changed. When new functionality is
        needed, a new class should be created instead of adding or changing to
        an existing one. This prevents breaking production code, and keeps the
        code base modular. It also aids in debugging since if there are bugs,
        you know the issue is in the new class instead of in the entire one
        class code base.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Liskow Substitution</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Liskow Substitution states that a subtype should be perfectly
        exchangable with its parent type. In order words, a child class should
        be able to used in place of a parent class without causing new
        exceptions. An effect of designing this way means that a client does not
        need to know the subtype it is invoking.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Interface Segregation</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Code should not depend on/implement methods it does not use. Instead of
        one giant interface that force clients to have numberous unrelated
        methods, it is better to have smaller specialized interfaces. This
        ensures that the client only have methods that are of interest to them
        which reduces bugs and spaghetti code.
      </p>
      <h2 class="sub-heading">Dependency Inversion</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        Dependency Inversion states that a higher level module should not
        directly depend on a lower level module. For example, in a UX ->
        Business Layer -> Data Layer system, the Data layer should not depend on
        a user clicking a button to access the database. Instead, interfaces
        should be implemented so each module is decoupled from one another. This
        allows the code to be reused and entire modules to be swapped out as
        needed.
